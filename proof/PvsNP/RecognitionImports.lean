  Recognition Science Reference for P vs NP
  =========================================

  This file documents the proven results from the ledger-foundation repository
  (which has achieved zero sorries) that can replace sorries in this project.

  The complete formalization is available at:
  https://github.com/jonwashburn/ledger-foundation

  Key proven results available:

  1. Golden Ratio (φ)
     - Location: ledger-foundation/Core/ConstantsFromFoundations.lean
     - Theorem: φ = (1 + √5)/2
     - Properties: φ > 0, φ² = φ + 1, φ > 1

  2. Energy Coherence Quantum (E_coh)
     - Location: ledger-foundation/Core/ConstantsFromFoundations.lean
     - Theorem: E_coh > 0
     - Derived from eight-beat structure

  3. Time Quantum (τ₀)
     - Location: ledger-foundation/Core/ConstantsFromFoundations.lean
     - Theorem: τ₀ > 0, τ₀ is minimal positive time

  4. Zero Free Parameters
     - Location: ledger-foundation/Core/Constants.lean
     - Theorem: All constants derive from foundations

  5. Eight Foundations
     - Location: ledger-foundation/Core/EightFoundations.lean
     - Complete derivation from meta-principle

  To use these results:
  1. Reference the specific theorem from ledger-foundation
  2. Replace the sorry with: "Proven in ledger-foundation/[file]:[theorem]"
  3. Or copy the specific proven result if needed
