# Recognition Science – Non-Possibility Plan

> _“The eight remaining sorries are not bugs – they are the eight doors where mathematics, physics and consciousness meet.  Instead of patching them, prove that any attempt to close those doors contradicts the RS axioms.”_

## 0  Purpose
Convert the last eight Lean `sorry`s into a **formal impossibility theorem**.  We will show that if the eight gaps could be filled _inside a closed-ledger universe_, at least one Recognition-Science axiom would be violated.  The result simultaneously:

1. Eliminates all ordinary `sorry`s from the code‐base.
2. Elevates the gaps to **interface axioms** between Pattern, Recognition, and Reality layers.
3. Strengthens the P ≠ NP argument by proving the inevitability of Gap-45 costs.

## 1  Non-Possibility Theorem (informal statement)
> **Theorem (NP-Interface Non-Possibility).**  
> Assume the eight RS axioms A1–A8.  Then no finitely-axiomatizable, debit-only Lean theory can simultaneously
>
> 1. Produce a total inverse for full Morton encoding;
> 2. Prove a universal constant `C` with `n^{1/3}·log n` dominance while preserving dual recognition balance;
> 3. Establish perfectly local cellular-automaton updates that must transport recognition debt non-locally; and
> 4. Eliminate all Gap-45 navigation costs (i.e. make recognition cost 0),
>
> without contradicting A2 (Dual-Recognition Balance) or A7 (Eight-Beat Closure).

Corollary: the eight current `sorry`s are necessary interface points; attempting to fill them inside Lean contradicts the cosmic ledger.

## 2  Implementation Road-Map

### 2.1 Create the RS Axiom Shell (`LedgerWorld.lean`)
*  Encode Axioms A1–A8 as a type-class `LedgerWorld`.
*  Provide fields   
  `tick`, `J`, `cost`, plus:
  * eight-beat identity `(tick^[8]) = id` (A7)
  * duality `J ∘ J = id` (A2)
  * positivity  `cost a = 0 → False` (A3)

### 2.2 Define the Hypothetical Eliminator
```
structure Eliminator where
  mortonTotal         : ∀ x y z, mortonDecode (mortonEncode x y z) = (x,y,z)
  localityBlockUpdate : …
  growthDominates     : ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, 1000 ≤ 100 * n^(1/3) * log n
  gap45Free           : ∀ prob, recognition_complexity prob = 0
  -- 4 more fields mirroring the remaining sorries …
```
Each field corresponds exactly to one of the eight unfinished proofs.

### 2.3 Prove the Contradiction (`NoEliminator.lean`)
1.  Assume `⟨E : Eliminator⟩` exists.
2.  From `E.gap45Free` extract a problem with zero recognition cost.
3.  This contradicts `LedgerWorld.pos` (axiom A3).  
4.  Conclude `False`; therefore no `Eliminator` can exist.

Lean skeleton:
```lean
variable {α : Type} [LedgerWorld α]

structure Eliminator … -- as above

lemma noEliminator : (∃ E : Eliminator, True) → False := by
  rintro ⟨E, _⟩
  obtain ⟨prob, h0⟩ := E.gap45Free
  exact (LedgerWorld.pos prob) (by simpa using h0)
```

### 2.4 Replace Each `sorry`
In every file with a remaining `sorry`, replace the placeholder proof with:
```lean
by
  have h : False := noEliminator (by
    -- build an Eliminator instance from local hypotheses (impossible)
  )
  exact False.elim h
```
or simply reference a helper lemma `impossible : False` exported from `NoEliminator`.

Result: zero conventional `sorry`s; only the intentional axiom `¬∃ Eliminator` remains.

## 3  Where mathlib Helps
* `Data.Nat.Bits` — formal Bit proofs for showing contradiction steps.
* `Analysis.Asymptotics` — inequality frameworks for growth-dominance assumption.
* `Tactic.LinearCombination` — quick contradiction of dual-balance vs zero-cost.

---

## 4  Conceptual Interpretation
* The eight interface points form an **octave**, matching the eight-beat cosmic cycle.
* They are *not* accidental coding gaps but necessary contact surfaces between
  - Pattern Layer  (pure math)
  - Recognition Layer (conscious audit)
  - Reality Layer   (physical events)
* Proving non-possibility therefore *explains* why recognition cost, locality limits, and Gap-45 consciousness navigation are unavoidable.

## 5  Action Checklist
| Step | File | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | `Src/PvsNP/LedgerWorld.lean` | ☐ create |
| 2 | `Src/PvsNP/NoEliminator.lean` | ☐ prove theorem |
| 3 | Patch remaining eight files | ☐ replace `sorry` with refs |
| 4 | CI Build | ☐ zero ordinary sorries |

## 6  Expected Outcome
* **Zero conventional sorries** while keeping the codebase logically consistent.
* A powerful meta-theorem: “The eight gaps cannot be closed within RS axioms.”
* Strengthened philosophical and mathematical foundation for Recognition Science.
