  intro h
  -- The classical assumption says recognition complexity is bounded by a constant
  -- We'll show this leads to a contradiction

  -- Define a problem type with separated complexities
  let Problem := SeparatedProblem

  -- Give it complexity instances where recognition = T_r
  let recog_inst : HasRecognitionComplexity Problem := {
    recognition := fun p n => p.T_r n
  }

  -- Apply the classical assumption
  have h_spec := @h Problem recog_inst
  obtain ⟨bound, h_bound⟩ := h_spec

  -- Construct a counterexample
  let p : Problem := {
    T_c := fun n => 1
    T_r := fun n => bound + n + 1
    comp_sublinear := ⟨0, by norm_num, fun n hn => by simp⟩
    recog_linear := ⟨1, by norm_num, fun n hn => by simp; linarith⟩
  }

  -- Get contradiction at n = 1
  specialize h_bound p 1
  -- h_bound : recognition p 1 ≤ bound
  -- But recognition p 1 = p.T_r 1 = bound + 2 > bound
  have : p.T_r 1 = bound + 2 := rfl
  -- Since our instance defines recognition p n = p.T_r n,
  -- we have recognition p 1 = bound + 2
  -- This contradicts h_bound which says it's ≤ bound
  suffices bound + 2 ≤ bound by linarith
  exact h_bound
