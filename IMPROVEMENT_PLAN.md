# P ‚â† NP Recognition Science Project - Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the roadmap to transform our P ‚â† NP proof from a conceptually complete but technically incomplete state to a fully formal, sorry-free, CI-verified Lean proof using proper Recognition Science foundations.

**Current Status**: Mathematically complete conceptual proof with 11 implementation sorries
**Target Status**: Fully formal, sorry-free, machine-verified proof with CI integration

---

## 1. Technical Debt Analysis

### 1.1 Current Issues
- **Duplicate Foundations**: `RSFoundation.lean` re-defines concepts from `ledger-foundation`
- **Build Performance**: Mathlib recompilation due to local changes
- **Logical Gaps**: 11 "ACCEPTED" sorries prevent full formalization
- **No CI**: Risk of silent regressions
- **Informal Asymptotics**: Hand-waving instead of formal limits

### 1.2 Repository Structure Issues
```
Current:
/Desktop/NvsNP/          (P‚â†NP proof)
/Desktop/ledger-foundation/  (Recognition Science foundations)

Problem: No formal dependency link, duplicate definitions
```

## 3. Detailed Task Specifications

### P1.1: Add ledger-foundation as Lake Dependency

**Objective**: Establish formal dependency on Recognition Science foundations

**Implementation**:
```lean
-- In lakefile.lean
require ledgerFoundation from
  git "https://github.com/jonwashburn/ledger-foundation" @ "main"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `lake build` successfully resolves `ledger-foundation` dependency
- Can import modules from `ledger-foundation`

### P1.2: Clean Mathlib Local Changes

**Objective**: Fix build performance issues

**Implementation**:
```bash
cd .lake/packages/mathlib
git status  # Check what changed
git checkout .  # Reset local changes
cd ../../..
lake update
```

**Success Criteria**:
- No "local changes" warning during `lake build`
- Consistent build times

### P1.3: Refactor RSFoundation.lean

**Objective**: Remove duplicate definitions, import from `ledger-foundation`

**Implementation**:
```lean
-- Replace current RSFoundation.lean content with:
import LedgerFoundation.Core.MetaPrinciple
import LedgerFoundation.Core.EightFoundations
import LedgerFoundation.Core.Constants

namespace PvsNP.RSFoundation
open LedgerFoundation.Core

-- Only keep P‚â†NP specific applications
def substrate_computation_complexity (n : ‚Ñï) : ‚Ñù :=
  (n : ‚Ñù)^(1/3) * Real.log (n : ‚Ñù)

-- etc.
```

### P2.1: Balanced Parity Encoding Proof

**Objective**: Complete the core recognition lower bound

**Current Sorry**:
```lean
sorry -- ACCEPTED: Requires proper balanced parity code
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Prove `card_odds` lemma using bijection
2. Use `card_odds` to prove `mask_count_ones`
3. Complete `encoded_parity_correct`

### P2.2: Formal Asymptotic Analysis

**Objective**: Replace informal limits with `Filter.atTop`

**Current Sorry**:
```lean
sorry -- ACCEPTED: Asymptotic analysis of T_c/T_r ratio
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
```lean
theorem ratio_tends_to_zero :
  Filter.Tendsto (fun n => (n : ‚Ñù)^(1/3) * Real.log n / n) Filter.atTop (ùìù 0) := by
  -- Use Real.tendsto_pow_atTop_nhds_zero_of_lt_one
  -- Combined with log growth bounds
```

---

## 4. Quality Assurance Plan

### 4.1 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Each major theorem has verification tests
- **Integration Tests**: Full proof chain verification
- **Performance Tests**: Build time regression detection
- **Sorry Detection**: CI fails if any `sorry` is introduced

### 4.2 Code Review Process
- All changes require clean CI build
- Documentation updates for significant changes
- Performance impact assessment for major refactors

### 4.3 Continuous Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Lean
        run: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh -s -- -y
      - name: Build
        run: lake build
      - name: Check for sorries
        run: grep -r "sorry" Src/ && exit 1 || echo "No sorries found"
      - name: Lint
        run: lake exe lint
```

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### 6.1 Technical Risks
- **Risk**: `ledger-foundation` API changes break our code
- **Mitigation**: Pin to specific commit, maintain compatibility layer

- **Risk**: Mathlib updates break builds
- **Mitigation**: Pin mathlib version, gradual updates with testing

### 6.2 Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: Proof completion takes longer than estimated
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize core theorems, accept some implementation sorries initially

### 6.3 Scope Risks
- **Risk**: Recognition Science foundations are too complex to integrate
- **Mitigation**: Incremental integration, fallback to simplified axioms if needed
