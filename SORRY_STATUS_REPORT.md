# P vs NP Proof - Sorry Reduction Status Report

## Summary
Working through sorries systematically. Currently at 14 sorries (added 1 helper lemma).

## Current Status (14 sorries remaining)

### Core.lean (1 sorry)
- `p_vs_np_ill_posed`: Type mismatch workaround for definitional equality issue

### RecognitionBound.lean (4 sorries)
- `card_odds` (NEW): Helper for counting odd numbers in Fin (4*m) 
- `mask_count_ones`: Counting odd numbers in range [0, n)
- `encoded_parity_correct`: Parity analysis of balanced encoding  
- `information_lower_bound`: Balanced code indistinguishability property

### SATEncoding.lean (9 sorries)
- `morton_simple_inverse`: Arithmetic properties of div/mod
- `morton_decode_encode`: Morton encoding bit-level properties
- `sat_computation_complexity` (2 sorries): Asymptotic bound and CA halts
- `block_update_affects_only_neighbors`: CA locality property
- `signal_speed`: Signal propagation bound
- `ca_computation_subpolynomial`: Follows from sat_computation_complexity
- `computation_recognition_gap`: Asymptotic gap analysis
- `ca_run_eventually_halts`: CA termination property

## Recent Progress (This Round)

### Attempted:
1. **`card_odds`**: Built bijection structure, blocked on proving `(2*k + 1) / 2 = k`
2. **`morton_simple_inverse`**: Detailed arithmetic proof attempt, hit Lean rewrite complexity
3. **Definitional equality in Core.lean**: Tried multiple approaches (simp lemma, change tactic) - appears to be Lean limitation

### Key Insights:
- Balanced parity needs helper lemmas for clean proofs
- Lean struggles with complex arithmetic rewrites involving div/mod
- Typeclass instance definitional equality is a known Lean issue

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Core fixes ✓ Complete (with workaround)
- Fixed compilation but definitional equality issue remains

### Phase 1: Balanced-parity lemmas (4 sorries)
- Added `card_odds` helper to structure the proof better
- Need to complete division properties
- Consider simpler encoding scheme

### Phase 2: Arithmetic helpers (2 sorries)  
- `morton_simple_inverse`: May need custom tactics or simpler encoding
- `morton_decode_encode`: Requires bit manipulation library

### Phase 3: CA/asymptotic properties (7 sorries)
- Still need to expand CA definitions
- Most should follow from construction

### Phase 4: Axiom audit
- No new axioms introduced
- Recognition Science axioms used as intended

## Technical Blockers

1. **Division arithmetic**: Need `(2*k + 1) / 2 = k` type lemmas
2. **Modulo arithmetic**: Complex chains like `(x + 1024*y + 1024²*z) % 1024² = x + 1024*y`
3. **Balanced codes**: Current flip-bit-0 encoding too weak for information theory

## Next Actions

1. Import more arithmetic lemmas from mathlib (e.g., `Nat.add_div_right`)
2. Consider alternative balanced parity scheme (e.g., flip all positions ≡ 0 mod 4)
3. Build small arithmetic tactic for base-B representations
