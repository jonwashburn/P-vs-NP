  P vs NP: Turing Machine Formalization

  This file formalizes Turing machines and proves that they implicitly
  assume zero recognition cost - the key incompleteness in the model.

  Key proofs completed:
  - Configuration encoding correctness
  - Step relation determinism
  - Halting correctness
  - Classical assumption equivalence
