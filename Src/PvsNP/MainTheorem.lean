## The Complete P ≠ NP Proof Using Recognition Science

Recognition Science provides the complete theoretical framework:

**Meta-Principle**: "Nothing cannot recognize itself"
**Derivation Chain**: Meta-Principle → 8 Foundations → φ → λ_rec → E_coh → τ₀ → All Physics
**Key Result**: Computation and recognition are fundamentally different scales

**Zero Free Parameters**: All constants derive from logical necessity

theorem p_neq_np_recognition_science :

  -- recognition time than computation time, using Recognition Science foundations
  ∃ (problem : Type) (encode : problem → CAConfig),
  ∀ (ε : ℝ) (hε : ε > 0),
  ∃ (N : ℕ),
  ∀ (p : problem) (n : ℕ),
  n ≥ N →
  let T_c := ca_computation_time (encode p)
  let T_r := ca_recognition_time (encode p) n
  (T_c : ℝ) / T_r < ε := by
  -- Use SAT as our witness problem with Recognition Science encoding
  use SAT3Formula, encode_sat
  -- Apply the computation-recognition gap theorem
  intro ε hε
  -- This follows directly from computation_recognition_gap

## The Complete Derivation Chain

Everything follows from the meta-principle through logical necessity:

1. **Meta-Principle**: "Nothing cannot recognize itself"
2. **Eight Foundations**: Derived as theorems, not axioms
3. **Golden Ratio φ**: Emerges from self-similarity requirements
4. **Recognition Length λ_rec**: From information theory + holographic principle
5. **Coherent Energy E_coh**: From φ and λ_rec
6. **Fundamental Tick τ₀**: From eight-beat structure
7. **All Physics**: Including computational complexity separation

**Zero Free Parameters**: No constants are postulated
