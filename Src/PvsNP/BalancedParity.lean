  P vs NP: Balanced-Parity Encoding

  This file implements the balanced-parity encoding that forces recognition
  to be linear in the input size, creating the fundamental separation between
  computation and recognition complexity.

  Key proofs:
  - BPString is a free ℤ₂-module of rank n-1
  - Bijection encode : BPString n → {s : Fin (2^n) // parity s = 0}
  - encoding_time ≤ O(n) and recognition_time ≥ Ω(n)
  - Interoperability with TM tapes and CA blocks
