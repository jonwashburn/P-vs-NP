  P vs NP: Core Module

  This is the main entry point that imports all components of the
  Recognition Science resolution of P vs NP.

namespace PvsNP

/-- A (toy) typeclass capturing the internal evolution complexity of a decision problem.  In a realistic development this would be refined to accept encodings and cost models; we start simple. -/
class HasComputationComplexity (α : Type) where
  computation : α → Nat → Nat   -- a function giving the worst-case number of internal steps for inputs of size n

/-- A typeclass capturing the recognition (observation) complexity: how many bits / voxels / tape cells must be inspected to read the answer.  -/
class HasRecognitionComplexity (α : Type) where
  recognition : α → Nat → Nat

/-- We package both complexities together.  -/
structure DualComplexity (α : Type) where
  T_c : Nat → Nat
  T_r : Nat → Nat

/-- **Turing-incompleteness lemma (informal)**
The classical Turing model implicitly sets recognition cost to zero.  We state this as a placeholder theorem that will be proved later once we formalise Turing machines. -/
@[simp] theorem turing_recognition_zero : True := by
  trivial

/-- Placeholder: the 16-state reversible cellular automaton that decides SAT with sub-polynomial internal time but linear recognition cost.  Here we merely record the statement without proof; subsequent files will construct the CA explicitly. -/
structure SAT_CA where
  -- implementation details will follow
  dummy : Unit := ()

/-- Computation-time theorem (to be proved): the CA decides 3-SAT in O(n^{1/3} log n) internal steps. -/
@[simp] theorem sat_ca_computation_bound (n : Nat) : True := by
  -- TODO: fill in proof once CA is defined
  trivial

/-- Recognition-time theorem (to be proved): any measurement protocol that queries fewer than `n / 2` cells errs with probability ≥ 1/4. -/
@[simp] theorem sat_ca_recognition_lower (n : Nat) : True := by
  -- TODO: information-theoretic proof
  trivial

/-- A 16-state reversible cellular automaton. We will fill in the transition rules and prove its computation / recognition complexities in later files. -/
