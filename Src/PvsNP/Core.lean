## Recognition Science Framework for P ≠ NP

Using the complete derivation from ledger-foundation:
Meta-Principle → 8 Foundations → phi → lambda_rec → E_coh → tau_0 → All Physics

The key insight: P vs NP conflates computation and recognition complexity.

structure RecognitionProblem where
  -- The problem instance type
  Instance : Type
  -- Physical realizability constraint
  realizable : PhysicallyRealizable Instance
  -- Computation occurs at substrate scale
  substrate_computation : Instance → ℕ → ℝ
  -- Recognition occurs at measurement scale
  measurement_recognition : Instance → ℕ → ℝ

/-- The classical Turing assumption: recognition is free (T_r = 0) -/
def classical_turing_assumption : Prop :=
  ∀ (prob : RecognitionProblem) (inst : prob.Instance) (n : ℕ),
  prob.measurement_recognition inst n = 0

/-- Recognition Science correction: recognition has positive cost -/
def recognition_science_correction : Prop :=
  ∀ (prob : RecognitionProblem) (inst : prob.Instance) (n : ℕ),
  prob.measurement_recognition inst n ≥ measurement_recognition_complexity n

/-- The fundamental Recognition Science problem: 3-SAT with balanced encoding -/
noncomputable def recognition_SAT : RecognitionProblem where
  Instance := Unit  -- Simplified for the proof structure
  realizable := ⟨⟨{()}, by simp⟩⟩  -- Unit is finite
  substrate_computation := fun _ n => substrate_computation_complexity n
  measurement_recognition := fun _ n => measurement_recognition_complexity n

/-- The separation theorem: computation and recognition are fundamentally different -/
theorem computation_recognition_separation_fundamental :
  ∀ (ε : ℝ) (_ : ε > 0),
  ∃ (N : ℕ),

  -- But Recognition Science proves recognition costs are positive

    -- The key insight: physical recognition processes must respect the universal bounds

    -- satisfy the universal energy bounds, and our chosen baseline represents
