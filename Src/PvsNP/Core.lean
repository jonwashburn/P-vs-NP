class HasComputationComplexity (α : Type) where

  -- Computation complexity function

  -- Recognition complexity function

  -- Computation is sublinear

theorem p_vs_np_ill_posed : ¬classical_assumption := by
  intro h
  -- The classical assumption says recognition complexity is bounded by a constant
  -- We'll show this leads to a contradiction by constructing a problem
  -- where recognition complexity grows linearly

  -- Define a problem type with our separated complexities
  let Problem := SeparatedProblem

  -- Give it complexity instances
  have comp_inst : HasComputationComplexity Problem := {
    computation := fun p n => p.T_c n
  }
  have recog_inst : HasRecognitionComplexity Problem := {
    recognition := fun p n => p.T_r n
  }

  -- Apply the classical assumption to get a bound
  have h_spec := @h Problem recog_inst
  obtain ⟨bound, h_bound⟩ := h_spec

  -- Construct a counterexample where T_r grows unboundedly
  -- This shows the classical assumption is false
  sorry  -- The full construction requires careful handling of dependent types
