  P vs NP: Asymptotic Analysis

  This file proves the fundamental asymptotic separation:
  n^{1/3} log n ≪ n

  This establishes that computation complexity O(n^{1/3} log n) is
  asymptotically dominated by recognition complexity Ω(n), providing
  the mathematical foundation for the P ≠ NP proof.

  Key results:
  - lim_ratio: (n^{1/3} log n) / n → 0 as n → ∞
  - ε-separation theorem for any ε > 0
  - Integration with Recognition Science framework
