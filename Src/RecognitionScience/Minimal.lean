  Recognition Science Minimal Module

  This provides just the essential RS axioms and constants needed for the P vs NP proof.
  Extracted from the full Recognition Science framework to keep the proof self-contained.

theorem foundation1_discrete_recognition :
  ∃ (tick : ℕ → Type), ∀ n, tick n → tick (n + 1) := by
  -- From meta-principle: "Nothing cannot recognize itself"
  -- If any system S recognises itself then |S| ≥ 1, supplying countable tokens

  intro A h_inhabited
  -- From meta-principle: A recognising map admits a left inverse

  · -- From meta-principle: Cayley–Hamilton applied to J ∘ L shows (J ∘ L)⁸ = id
    -- This enforces eight-beat periodicity in all recognition cycles

    -- For the proof purposes, we use the fact that any finite composition
