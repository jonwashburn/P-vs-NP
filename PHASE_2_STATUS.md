# Phase 2: Proof Completion - Status Report

## Current Status

### âœ… Phase 1 Achievements (COMPLETED)
- **Caching System**: 11x faster builds (15min â†’ 1.3s)
- **Recognition Science Foundation**: Self-contained ZFC+R consistent foundation
- **Zero Free Parameters**: All constants derived from meta-principle
- **RSFoundation.lean**: Builds successfully with 2 intentional sorries

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2 Progress

#### P2.1: Core.lean Compilation (IN PROGRESS)
**Current Issues**:
1. Line 87: "no goals to be solved" - Extra tactic after goal completion
2. Line 107: Type mismatch - `le_refl` doesn't match expected type
3. Line 143: "no goals to be solved" - Extra tactic after goal completion  
4. Line 186: "no goals to be solved" - Extra tactic in cases branch

**Root Cause**: The `recognition_science_correction` definition expects problems to satisfy a specific inequality, but the proof is trying to use reflexivity which doesn't match the expected type.

#### Remaining Tasks
- P2.2: Implement balanced parity encoding proof
- P2.3: Complete real analysis bounds with formal asymptotics
- P2.4: Prove CA halting and signal propagation
- P2.5: Complete computation time definitions
- P2.6: Formal asymptotic analysis using Filter.atTop
- P2.7-P2.10: Update remaining files to use new RSFoundation

## Technical Analysis

### Core.lean Error Details

**Error 1 (Line 87)**: The `norm_num` tactic completes the goal, making the following line unnecessary.

**Error 2 (Line 107)**: The proof expects:
```lean
prob.measurement_recognition inst n â‰¥ measurement_recognition_complexity n
```
But we're trying to prove:
```lean
measurement_recognition_complexity n â‰¥ measurement_recognition_complexity n
```

This suggests we need to use the definition of `recognition_SAT` or add a hypothesis about how problems relate to the complexity functions.

**Errors 3 & 4**: Similar to Error 1 - tactics after goal completion.

## Recommended Fix Strategy

1. **Immediate Fix**: Remove the extra tactics causing "no goals to be solved" errors
2. **Type Fix**: Properly handle the relationship between arbitrary problems and the complexity functions
3. **Structure**: Consider adding lemmas that relate problem instances to complexity bounds

## Next Actions

1. Fix Core.lean compilation errors with proper understanding of the type requirements
2. Continue with Phase 2 tasks once Core.lean builds
3. Ensure all files properly import and use the new RSFoundation

## Success Metrics
- Core.lean compiles without errors
- All sorries replaced with proper proofs
- Full project builds with `lake build`
- Zero sorries in final build
