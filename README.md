This repository contains a complete formalization in Lean 4 of a new approach to the P vs NP problem through Recognition Science - a two-parameter model of physical computation.

## Key Result

We show that P vs NP is ill-posed because it conflates two distinct complexity measures:
- **Computation Complexity (T_c)**: Internal state evolution  
- **Recognition Complexity (T_r)**: Measurement/observation cost

Using a 16-state reversible cellular automaton, we prove:
- SAT has computation complexity T_c = O(n^{1/3} log n)
- SAT has recognition complexity T_r = Î©(n)

This separation suggests:
- At computation scale: P = NP (both polynomial)
- At recognition scale: P â‰  NP (linear vs polynomial gap)
