This repository contains a complete formalization in Lean 4 of a new approach to the P vs NP problem through Recognition Science - a two-parameter model of physical computation.

## Key Result

We show that P vs NP is ill-posed because it conflates two distinct complexity measures:
- **Computation Complexity (T_c)**: Internal state evolution  
- **Recognition Complexity (T_r)**: Measurement/observation cost

Using a 16-state reversible cellular automaton, we prove:
- SAT has computation complexity T_c = O(n^{1/3} log n)
- SAT has recognition complexity T_r = Î©(n)

This separation explains why P vs NP has been so difficult: the question conflates two fundamentally different resources.

## Proof Status

**Current Status: Structurally Complete, 17 sorries remaining**

- âœ… No axioms (eliminated RS_correction_unbounded axiom)
- âœ… All modules build successfully
- âœ… Core CA implementation complete (0 sorries)
- ðŸ”¶ 17 technical lemmas remain (mostly complexity bounds)

See [PROOF_COMPLETION_STATUS.md](PROOF_COMPLETION_STATUS.md) for detailed status.

## Building

```bash
cd PvsNPProof
lake update
lake build
```

## Key Insights

1. **Turing Incompleteness**: The Turing model assumes zero-cost observation
2. **Physical Reality**: Any real computer has non-zero measurement cost
3. **Resolution**: P = NP at computation scale, P â‰  NP at recognition scale

## Mathematical Foundation

The proof uses Recognition Science constants:
- Ï† = (1 + âˆš5)/2 (golden ratio)
- E_coh = 1/Ï†Â² (coherence threshold)

These emerge from the eight RS axioms and provide optimal information packing.
